	My code implements a solution to the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists. The linked lists represent non-negative integers, and the digits are stored in reverse order. Here's an explanation of the approach I have followed:
	
	1. **Initialization:**
	   - I start by initializing the `head` of the result linked list to `null`.
	   - `data` is used to store the sum of digits at a particular position.
	   - `carry` is used to store the carry value when the sum of digits is greater than or equal to 10.
	
	2. **Traversal:**
	   - I use a `while` loop to iterate through the linked lists `l1` and `l2` as long as either of them is not `null` or there is a carry value.
	
	3. **Calculating Sum:**
	   - Inside the loop, I calculate the sum of digits at the current position:
	     - `data = carry`: Initialize `data` with the carry from the previous iteration.
	     - If `l1` is not `null`, add the value of the current node of `l1` to `data`, and move `l1` to the next node.
	     - If `l2` is not `null`, add the value of the current node of `l2` to `data`, and move `l2` to the next node.
	
	4. **Updating Carry and Data:**
	   - Calculate the new carry as `carry = data / 10`.
	   - Update `data` as `data = data % 10`.
	
	5. **Creating a New Node:**
	   - Create a new `ListNode` (`curr`) with the calculated `data`.
	
	6. **Updating Result Linked List:**
	   - If `prev` is `null`, set `head` to `curr` (this is the first node in the result linked list).
	   - If `prev` is not `null`, set the `next` of `prev` to `curr` (linking the current node to the previous one).
	
	7. **Move to the Next Iteration:**
	   - Update `prev` to `curr`, preparing for the next iteration of the loop.
	
	8. **Return Result:**
	   - Once the loop is complete, return the `head` of the resulting linked list.
	
The approach I've followed is a straightforward iterative process that mimics the process of adding numbers manually,
starting from the least significant digit and moving towards the most significant digit, while considering carry values. 
This solution has a time complexity of O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists.
