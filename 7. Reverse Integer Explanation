Algorithm:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Declare and initialize variables:
     - `reverse`: To store the reversed integer.
     - `neg`: A boolean variable to indicate whether the original integer was negative. Initialized to `false`.
  
2. **Handle Negative Input:**
   - Check if the input `x` is negative.
   - If it is, set the `neg` variable to `true` and convert `x` to its absolute value by negating it.

3. **Reverse the Integer:**
   - Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Check if the current value of `reverse` would overflow when multiplied by 10 (checking against `Integer.MAX_VALUE/10` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE/10`).
     - If overflow is detected, return 0 to indicate that the reversal would result in an overflow.
     - Otherwise, calculate the remainder (`rem`) by taking the modulus of `x` with 10.
     - Update `reverse` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the remainder.

4. **Handle Negative Result:**
   - If the original integer was negative, negate the `reverse` variable to make it negative.

5. **Return the Reversed Integer:**
   - Return the final reversed integer.

### Explanation:

- The algorithm uses a `while` loop to reverse the digits of the input integer.
- It checks for integer overflow conditions during the reversal process.
- The use of the `neg` variable ensures that the sign of the original integer is preserved in the reversed integer.
- The reversed integer is continuously built by adding the remainder of the division by 10 in each iteration.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(x)), where x is the input integer. This is because the number of digits in the integer determines the number of iterations in the loop.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

In summary, the code efficiently reverses an integer, taking into account potential overflow conditions and preserving the sign of the original integer.
