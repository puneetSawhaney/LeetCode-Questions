I have implemented an approach to find the longest palindromic substring using the "Expand Around Center" method. Here's an explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize an empty string `result` to store the longest palindromic substring found.

2. **Odd-Length Palindromes:**
   - For each character in the input string (`s`), consider it as the potential center of an odd-length palindrome (`axis`).

   - Initialize `orbit` to 1, representing the distance from the center to the edge of the palindrome.

   - Initialize `len` to 1, representing the length of the palindrome with the center character.

3. **Expansion for Odd-Length Palindromes:**
   - Use a while loop to expand the palindrome by checking if the characters on both sides of the center are equal.

   - If they are equal, increment `orbit` and update `len` by 2.

   - If the characters are not equal, break out of the loop.

   - Update the `result` if the length of the current palindrome is greater than the length of the previous result.

4. **Even-Length Palindromes:**
   - Repeat a similar process for even-length palindromes, considering each pair of adjacent characters as the potential center.

   - Initialize `orbit`, `len`, and `axis` accordingly.

   - Use the while loop to expand the palindrome for even-length cases.

   - Update the `result` if the length of the current palindrome is greater than the length of the previous result.

5. **Return Result:**
   - After both loops are complete, return the `result`, which contains the longest palindromic substring.

This approach has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the length of the input string. The nested loops iterate over each character in the string, and the expansion around each center takes linear time. Overall, it efficiently identifies palindromes by expanding around their centers, considering both odd and even-length cases.
