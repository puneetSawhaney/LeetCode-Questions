My Solution is a Java implementation of the threeSum problem, where the goal is to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to a target value of zero. The code uses a combination of sorting, two-pointer technique, and a HashSet to achieve this. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `result`: A list of lists to store the unique triplets.
   - `set`: A HashSet to store unique combinations of triplets using a custom hash function.
   - `Target`: The target sum, which is set to zero in this case.
   - Sort the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the sorted array `nums`.
   - Inside the loop, set a new target (`newTarget`) as the difference between the target (`Target`) and the current element (`nums[i]`).

3. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Initialize two pointers (`li` and `ri`) to find pairs that sum up to the `newTarget`.
   - Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `li` is less than `ri`.
   - If the sum of elements at `li` and `ri` is less than `newTarget`, increment `li`.
   - If the sum is greater than `newTarget`, decrement `ri`.
   - If the sum is equal to `newTarget`, a triplet is found:
     - Calculate a custom hash for the triplet using the `gethash` function.
     - If the hash is not in the HashSet, add the triplet to the result and add the hash to the HashSet.
     - Increment `li` and decrement `ri`.

4. **Custom Hash Function:**
   - The `gethash` function combines the three values (x, y, z) into a long integer using a multiplication and addition approach. This is done to uniquely represent each triplet.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the `result` list containing all unique triplets.

### Explanation:

- The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that sorting the array allows for efficient use of the two-pointer technique.
- The custom hash function helps in identifying and avoiding duplicate triplets.
- The HashSet (`set`) is used to store unique combinations of triplets to ensure uniqueness in the result.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the code involves sorting the array and then using two pointers to iterate through the array.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The HashSet is used to store unique combinations of triplets, and in the worst case, it could store all unique triplets.

In summary, my submitted code efficiently finds all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero using a combination of sorting, the two-pointer technique, and a HashSet to ensure uniqueness in the result. The custom hash function plays a crucial role in avoiding duplicates.
