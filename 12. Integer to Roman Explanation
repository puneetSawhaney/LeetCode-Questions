Algorithm:

1. **Initialize StringBuilder:**
   - Create a `StringBuilder` named `sb` to build the Roman numeral representation.

2. **Process Thousands Place (M):**
   - Call the `process` method to handle the thousands place (M) using the character '*'. The value of `num/1000` gives the number of thousands.
   - Update `num` by taking the remainder after dividing by 1000.

3. **Process Hundreds Place (C, D):**
   - Call the `process` method to handle the hundreds place (C, D) using characters 'M', 'C', and 'D'. The value of `num/100` gives the number of hundreds.
   - Update `num` by taking the remainder after dividing by 100.

4. **Process Tens Place (X, L):**
   - Call the `process` method to handle the tens place (X, L) using characters 'C', 'X', and 'L'. The value of `num/10` gives the number of tens.
   - Update `num` by taking the remainder after dividing by 10.

5. **Process Units Place (I, V):**
   - Call the `process` method to handle the units place (I, V) using characters 'X', 'I', and 'V'. The value of `num` is used directly.

6. **Process Method:**
   - The `process` method takes the `StringBuilder` (`sb`), major, minor, middle characters, and the value of the current digit.
   - It appends the appropriate Roman numeral characters based on the value of the digit, considering the rules of Roman numerals.

Explanation of the Process Method:

- The method appends characters based on the value of the digit:
  - If the value is 1 to 3, it appends the minor character repeatedly.
  - If the value is 4, it appends the minor character followed by the middle character.
  - If the value is 5, it appends the middle character.
  - If the value is 6 to 8, it appends the middle character followed by the minor character repeatedly.
  - If the value is 9, it appends the minor character followed by the major character.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is constant because the number of digits in a Roman numeral representation is fixed.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also constant as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

In summary, the code efficiently converts an integer to its Roman numeral representation by processing each digit and building the representation accordingly.
