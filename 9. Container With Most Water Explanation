Algorithm:

1. Initialize three variables:
   - `res`: A variable to store the maximum area. It is initialized to 0.
   - `li`: A left pointer initially pointing to the start of the `height` array.
   - `ri`: A right pointer initially pointing to the end of the `height` array.

2. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as the left pointer (`li`) is less than the right pointer (`ri`).

3. Inside the loop:
   - Retrieve the heights of the vertical lines at positions `li` and `ri`, storing them in the variables `left` and `right`, respectively.
   - Calculate the area formed by these two vertical lines and the distance between them using the formula `Math.min(left, right) * (ri - li)`.
   - Update the `res` variable with the maximum of its current value and the calculated area.

4. Move the pointers:
   - If the height of the left vertical line is less than the height of the right vertical line (`left < right`), increment the left pointer (`li`).
   - Otherwise, decrement the right pointer (`ri`).

5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the left pointer surpasses the right pointer.

6. Return the final result stored in the `res` variable, representing the maximum area.

Explanation:

- My code starts with two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.
- It calculates the area formed by the current pair of vertical lines and updates the `res` variable with the maximum area encountered so far.
- The key insight is that to maximize the area, we need to consider pairs of lines that are tall and have a wide separation.
- By moving the pointers toward each other (choosing the taller line to move), we ensure that the width decreases and only taller lines can potentially increase the area.

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `height` array. This is because each pointer moves at most n times.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

In summary, the algorithm efficiently finds the maximum area by adjusting the pointers strategically to explore potentially larger areas between taller vertical lines in the histogram.
