ThreeSumClosest problem:
The goal of the problem is to find three integers in an array whose sum is closest to a given target integer. Here's an explanation of the code:


class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Sort the array to make it easier to find the closest sum
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Initialize result and gap variables
        int result = 0;
        int gap = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Iterate through the array, considering each element as a potential starting point
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
            int li = i + 1; // Left index
            int ri = nums.length - 1; // Right index

            // Use two-pointer approach to find a triplet sum
            while (li < ri) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[li] + nums[ri];

                // Update the result and gap if the current sum is closer to the target
                if (sum < target) {
                    int newGap = target - sum;
                    if (newGap < gap) {
                        gap = newGap;
                        result = sum;
                    }
                    li++;
                } else if (sum > target) {
                    int newGap = sum - target;
                    if (newGap < gap) {
                        gap = newGap;
                        result = sum;
                    }
                    ri--;
                } else {
                    // If the sum is equal to the target, return the sum as it is the closest
                    return sum;
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the closest sum found during the iteration
        return result;
    }
}
Explanation:

1. The array `nums` is sorted to simplify the process of finding the closest sum.

2. The code uses a loop to iterate through the array, considering each element as a potential starting point for the triplet.

3. Inside the loop, a two-pointer approach (`li` and `ri`) is used to find the triplet sum. The pointers start at the next element and the last element, respectively.

4. The code compares the current triplet sum with the target and updates the `result` and `gap` if the current sum is closer to the target.

5. The loop continues until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.

6. If the sum is equal to the target, the function returns the sum, as it is the closest possible sum.

7. Finally, the function returns the closest sum found during the iteration.
