My Solution is a Java implementation of a function that finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings (`strs`). The algorithm compares characters at corresponding positions in the strings to determine the common prefix. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

### Algorithm:

1. **Check for Empty Input:**
   - If the array of strings (`strs`) is empty (length is 0), return an empty string, as there is no common prefix to find.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `prefix`: A variable to represent the length of the common prefix. Initialized to 0.

3. **Iterate Through Characters:**
   - Enter an infinite `while` loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Check if the index `prefix` is less than the length of the first string in the array (`strs[0]`). If not, break out of the loop.

4. **Check Common Character:**
   - For each iteration, initialize a boolean variable `CharMatched` to true.
   - Get the character at position `prefix` from the first string (`strs[0]`) and store it in the variable `ch`.
   - Iterate through each string in the array (`strs`) using a `for` loop:
     - Check if the current string has a character at position `prefix` and if it matches the character `ch`.
     - If the characters match for all strings, update `prefix` by incrementing it.
     - If the characters do not match for any string, set `CharMatched` to false and break out of the loop.

5. **Build the Resulting Common Prefix:**
   - Return the substring of the first string (`strs[0]`) from index 0 to `prefix` as the resulting common prefix.

### Explanation:

- The algorithm uses a loop to iterate through characters in the strings until a mismatch is found or the end of the shortest string is reached.
- The `CharMatched` boolean helps determine whether the characters at the current position (`prefix`) are common for all strings.
- The `while` loop breaks when either the end of the shortest string is reached or a mismatch is found.
- The resulting common prefix is obtained by extracting the substring of the first string up to the index `prefix`.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the length of the longest string, and n is the number of strings in the array. This is because the algorithm iterates through characters in the strings.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

In summary, the solution efficiently finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings by comparing characters at corresponding positions until a mismatch is encountered or the end of the shortest string is reached. The resulting common prefix is then returned.
